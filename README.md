## Introduction     
This respository contains resources given to students of the CS321 course taught at the Mediterranean Institute of Techology in 2020.
It includes a guide on GitHub and Git, mockups and a document on how to get started.

## Getting Started    

First, students should get familiar with GitHub and the underlying techology it relies on called `Git`. For that, we strongly recommend reading the [GitHub Guide](https://github.com/MedTech-CS321/smuportal-resources/blob/master/GitHub_Guide_CS321.pdf) attached in this repository. Feel free to follow other guides online, however make sure to understand all the concepts highlighted in that guide. Namely:
- Git CLI essential commands
- Repository cloning and commit history
- Forking and PRs
- Branches and merge conflicts
- Techniques of merge conflicts resolution

Then, please visit the [Getting Started Guide - SMU Portal](https://app.gitbook.com/@smu-portal/s/get-started/). The document explains the architecture, coding style and concepts used in SMU Portal. Detailed steps on how to setup and deploy both the front-end and the back-end are also included. As the authors of this guide, we give our recommendations and a list resources for beginners and more experienced developers. Finally, recurrent problems encountered by students and their solutions are can be found in the "Troubleshooting" section.

## Mockups
Old mockups used during the development of SMU Portal are included as references for how the UX/UI should be.
To open and edit them, please download [Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html). You can also convert xd files to a format that can be read by Figma [here](https://xd2sketch.com/converter/xd-to-figma).
